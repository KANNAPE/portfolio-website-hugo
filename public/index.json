I remember playing them as a kid and being amazed by the worlds and stories they could create. It was like magic! As I grew older, I started to wonder how these games were made and what it took to create them. That\u0026rsquo;s when I discovered game development and realized that it was something I wanted to pursue as a career.\nProgramming then became evident. I started with C++ and SFML, then moved on to C# with Unity, and eventually discovered Unreal Engine, which I\u0026rsquo;ve been using ever since.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","title":"About","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"\rExperiences\r2024 — Today: Kylotonn - KT Racing\r🏎️ Endurance Motorsport Series\rlink\rSince January 2024, I\u0026rsquo;m working as a gameplay programmer on Endurance Motorsport Series, an endurance racing game.\nTasks:\nImplementing and maintaining gameplay \u0026amp; 3C features Working on networking systems Implementing and maintaining UI features Adding new features in engine 2023: Artefacts Studio\r⚔️ Crown Wars: The Black Prince\rlink\rFrom March 2023 to September 2023, I worked as a gameplay programmer on Crown Wars: The Black Prince, a tactical RPG.\nTasks:\nImplementing gameplay algorithms Working on cinematics Optimizing game assets integration Maintaining tools for the design team Education\r2020 — 2023: Creajeux\r🎮 Bachelor of Computer Science\rFrom September 2020 to June 2023, I studied at Creajeux, a game development school in Nîmes, France.

I really enjoyed the idea we had in my team, and I wanted to explore a bit further on the deckbuilding mechanics.

I plan to add a quizz game to it, but for now, I\u0026rsquo;m still working on the API and the backend.

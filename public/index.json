I remember playing them as a kid and being amazed by the worlds and stories they could create. It was like magic! As I grew older, I started to wonder how these games were made and what it took to create them. That\u0026rsquo;s when I discovered game development and realized that it was something I wanted to pursue as a career.\nProgramming then became evident. I started with C++ and SFML, then moved on to C# with Unity, and eventually discovered Unreal Engine, which I\u0026rsquo;ve been using ever since.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"KANNAPE • Portfolio","summary":"","title":"About","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"\rProfessional experiences\rEndurance Motorsport Series\r","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/experience/","section":"KANNAPE • Portfolio","summary":"","title":"Experience","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/","section":"KANNAPE • Portfolio","summary":"","title":"KANNAPE • Portfolio","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/projects/","section":"Projects","summary":"","title":"Projects","type":"projects"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/series/","section":"Series","summary":"","title":"Series","type":"series"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags","type":"tags"}]

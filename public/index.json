I remember playing them as a kid and being amazed by the worlds and stories they could create. It was like magic! As I grew older, I started to wonder how these games were made and what it took to create them. That\u0026rsquo;s when I discovered game development and realized that it was something I wanted to pursue as a career.\nProgramming then became evident. I started with C++ and SFML, then moved on to C# with Unity, and eventually discovered Unreal Engine, which I\u0026rsquo;ve been using ever since.\n","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/about/","section":"","summary":"","title":"About","type":"page"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/authors/","section":"Authors","summary":"","title":"Authors","type":"authors"},{"content":"","externalUrl":null,"permalink":"/categories/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"Categories","type":"categories"},{"content":"\rProfessional experiences\rEndurance Motorsport Series\rEndurance racing game — Gameplay Programmer\rProprietary Engine\rSince January 2024, I\u0026rsquo;m working as a gameplay programmer on Endurance Motorsport Series, an endurance racing game.\nTasks:\nImplementing and maintaining gameplay \u0026amp; 3C features Working on networking systems Implementing and maintaining UI features Adding new features in engine Crown Wars: The Black Prince\rTactical RPG — Gameplay Programmer\rUnreal Engine\rFrom March 2023 to September 2023, I worked as a gameplay programmer on Crown Wars: The Black Prince, a tactical RPG.\nTasks:\nImplementing gameplay algorithms Working on cinematics Optimizing game assets integration Maintaining tools for the design team Personal projects\rFracture\rlink\rGame prototype — UI \u0026amp; Online gameplay\rUnreal Engine\rSince March 2025, I\u0026rsquo;m working on my free time on a game prototype called Fracture.

## About me

I've always been fascinated by video games. I remember playing them as a kid and being amazed by the worlds and stories they could create. It was like magic! As I grew older, I started to wonder how these games were made and what it took to create them. That's when I discovered game development and realized that it was something I wanted to pursue as a career.

Programming then became evident. I started with C++ and SFML, then moved on to C# with Unity, and eventually discovered Unreal Engine, which I've been using ever since.

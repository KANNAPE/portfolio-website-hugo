Since <b class="date-timeline">March 2025</b>, I'm working on my free time on a game prototype called *Fracture*. <br><br>I wanted to recreate the feeling of **freedom and exploration** of the character controller from the game *Anthem*.<br>I'm also using this project to learn the **Mover component** from Unreal Engine, and how to manage **networking and online classes and subsystems**.

In <b class="date-timeline">January 2021</b>, at Creajeux, I worked as a graduation project on what would become **MushParade** today. <br><br>I really enjoyed the idea we had in my team, and I wanted to explore a bit further on the **deckbuilding mechanics**. That's why I started this small game prototype, and I'm still working on it in my free time.

{{< timelineItem md="true" link="https://github.com/KANNAPE/go-quizz-web-app" icon="github" header="Go Quizz Web App" subheader="Web application — Quizz game" >}}

In <b class="date-timeline">June 2025</b>, I discovered **Golang** and got fan of it. <br><br>I wondered if I could create a **web application** that would simulate a simple chat lobby, where users could connect to a room, and send messages via a **websocket** connection. I plan to add a quizz game to it, but for now, I'm still working on the API and the backend. <br><br>Soon to be updated!

Since <b style="color: rgb(var(--color-primary-300));">March 2025</b>, I'm working on my free time on a game prototype called *Fracture*. <br><br>I wanted to recreate the feeling of **freedom and exploration** of the character controller from the game *Anthem*.<br>I'm also using this project to learn the **Mover component** from Unreal Engine, and how to manage **networking and online classes and subsystems**.
